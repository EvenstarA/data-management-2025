# data-management-2025
Repository for Data Management Honours Module at UCT (2025).

The purpose of this repository is for an assignment for the Honour's Data Management Course, 2025.

The contents of this repository include a data set of pitfall trap contents, specifically ant species, species counts, and quadrat data based on soil surface features (i.e. bare ground, leaf litter etc.). Basic data anaylses and visualisations are performed in the R-scriot (data_analyses.R), and versions of the raw and clean data is available in .xlsx and .csv formats. Data was collected by myself with the assistance of Timothy Muasya and Lindiwe Khosa, during a field trip in Jan-Feb 2024. 

In addition, my thought process and analyses are documented in a readable and shareable format, found in quarto_writeup.qmd.
