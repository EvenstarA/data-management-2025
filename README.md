# data-management-2025
Repository for Data Management Honours Module at UCT (2025).

The purpose of this repository is for an assignment for the Honour's Data Management Course, 2025.

The contents of this repository include an analysis and data based on a third year project I fulfilled last year. Data collection was carried out by myself with the assistance of Timothy Muasya and Lindiwe Khosa, during a field trip in Jan-Feb 2024. The sorting of data used in this demonstratory analysis (i.e. counting, identifying and sorting the ants from each pitfall trap) was carried out by myself. 

The data includes ant genus names, species counts, and percentage cover of various surface features (i.e. bare ground, leaf litter etc.) around each pitfall trap, assessed using a quadrat. Basic data anaylses and visualisations were performed in the RScript (analyses.R), and versions of the raw and clean data is available in the data folder, in .xlsx and .csv formats where relevant.

In addition to the RScript, a more thorough, step-by-step guide to my thought process is documented in a more user-friendly manner, under the analyses_quarto.qmd file. This includes written paragraphs preceding chunks of code, details of packages used and the justification behind my analysis and coding. If there are issues with running the main RScript, the Quarto document may hold a clearer explanation which may assist in trouble shooting. The figures output from analyses can be found in the images file. 

To replicate the analyses, you will need to download the following: 
- Data Management Course 2025.Rproj
- analyses.R
- pitfall_data_clean.csv
- quadrat_data_clean.csv
- analyses_quarto.qmd

It may be beneficial to read the session info for software details.

Meta data, the raw data file, and the output figures can be found in the data/raw folder, and images folder on GitHub.
The analyses_quarto.html, and .qmd file are available for interest's sake, and contain the step-by-step narration of the analysis process.
